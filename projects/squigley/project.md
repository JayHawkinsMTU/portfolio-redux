Squigley is a 2D platformer that I developed during my freshman year of
college. Though far from a perfect game, it was a project I was determined
to see through to the end.

The game was developed using **Unity 2D** and **C#**, which helped reinforce
the object-oriented programming paradigm that I was learning in my classes.
I went into college hoping computer science would teach me everything I
needed to build projects like video games as a hobby. Working on *Squigley*
during my first year really got me excited to learn more and improve my skills.

Being a solo developer, I also did most of the art and music, though I also
collaborated with some friends back home I was in a band with for the song that
plays during the end-credits. This was the biggest music recording and
composition project I've done to date.

### Fun Facts

During my freshman year of high-school, I made a simple 2D platforming game
called *Squirby* using Python's turtle graphics for a programming class.
*Squigley* was initially meant to be a simple remake of that, but I kept
expanding upon it because I was having a lot of fun with it.

*Squirby* (now lost to time) influenced some crucial parts of the game's
branding.
- The name *Squirby* stems from "square" + "kirby" because you play as a
  square character. Similarly, *Squigley* comes from "square" + "quigley".
- *Squigley's* slanted face stems from a programming error from *Squirby*,
  where I messed up the number values when drawing the square representing
  the player's eye.
