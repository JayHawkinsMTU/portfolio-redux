[HIDE](https://hide.cs.mtu.edu/), or the *Humane Interface Design Enterprise* 
is a student organization at MTU that creates applications, often times 
sponsored by other organizations. In the spring of 2025, I joined on the
Machine Shop Check-In project.

The web-app was designed to streamline the process of tracking student usage
of tools from the machine shop on campus as well as authorizing students to
use machines given their record of training.

I worked on the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/)
back-end, which communicated with a **SQLite** database containing registered
students, their machine trainings, and the check-in/check-out time for each
machine.
