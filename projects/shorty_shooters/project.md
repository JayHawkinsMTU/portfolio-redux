*The little guys are bringing out the **big guns***

*Shorty Shooters* was developed as a team of 6 over the course of a semester as
a part of MTU's [Husky Game Development Enterprise](https://huskygames.com/).

The game is an online multiplayer party game where the objective is to score on
other players by eliminating them. The gimmick is that the guns are comically
oversized compared to the players holding them and the recoil sends them all
backwards.

I worked on most of the gameplay features, art, and sound implementation while
other members were responsible for network programming, music, and other
gameplay mechanics.

The game was created in *Godot* -- an open-source game engine -- using the
engine's custom language *GDScript*, which is almost identical to Python, but
has a little more emphasis on being object oriented.
